### Idea for assignment

Introduce the tidyverse suite of packages for R programming by comparing base R lessons covered in this course to the *Hadley* alternatives.

### Notes
* Must have an explaination for the purpose of the tidyverse packages
* Will have to include a bunch of external material
* Can potential co-opt the SW/D Carpentry lesson materials
