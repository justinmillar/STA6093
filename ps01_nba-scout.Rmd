### Ideas for assignment
* Check for outliers/missing values
* Create summary statistics/tables
    + Sorting by categories
    + Summary statistics
* Compare simple vs. multiple linear regression
*  Interpret results from `lm()`
* Use regression to make predictions
 
### Notes
* Data sources:
* Reminder it introduces messiness into data
* Need to include summary of variables
