<div id="the-assignment" class="section level2">
<h2>The Assignment</h2>
<p>Compile a <strong>three page</strong> report that addresses a series of objectives (see below). Your report should consist of a explanatory text as well as table and figures, and the R code you created for your analysis. This could be submitted either as a Word document and a R script, or in a comprehensive <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R Markdown</a> file (this is the preferred method).</p>
<div id="objective-1-data-validation" class="section level3">
<h3>Objective 1: Data Validation</h3>
<p>The previous analytics scout wasn’t known for their rigorous data keeping (which is why you’re here now). Before your start your analysis, be sure there aren’t any erroneous entries in either the <code>prospects</code> or <code>players</code> files. If there are outliers, be sure to remove them from the data and provide a rationale for why each outlier was removed.</p>
</div>
<div id="objective-2-descriptive-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3>Objective 2: Descriptive Analysis</h3>
<p>Your general manager has asked you to provide a statistical summary of this year’s prospects. She hasn’t explicitly asked for specific comparisons, so it’s up to you to design the descriptive report using the <code>prospects</code> file. Maybe you want to compare positions, or find the top prospects in each statistical category. It’s up to you!</p>
<p>Remember that the front office is not full of stats people, so it’s best to rely on graphs whenever possible.</p>
</div>
<div id="objective-3-linear-regression" class="section level3">
<h3>Objective 3: Linear Regression</h3>
<p>The team’s coach is an old-school guy. He thinks if you want to know how many points per game a prospect will score in the NBA, all you need is how many points they scored in college. Your general manager believes that it’s important to included additional information.</p>
<p>You’ve been tasked with settling the debate. Using the <code>players</code> data, create a simple linear regression using collegiate points per game to model NBA points per game, as well as a multiple regression that includes additional covariates. Then compare each model and determine who is right.</p>
<p>Once again, it up to you to decide which variables to include, how you want to select the best multiple regression model, and the best way to compare both models to each other. Your analysis should clearly state which choices you make and why, and address underlying assumptions behind these models.</p>
</div>
<div id="objective-4-predictive-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3>Objective 4: Predictive Analysis</h3>
<p>The moment of truth. The team has decided it wants to pick the best scorer in the draft. It is up to you use create a model using the <code>players</code> data with <code>nba_ppg</code> as the response/dependent variable and use that model to predict the best scorer in the <code>prospects</code> data. Be sure describe why you’ve chosen your model, which predictor/independent variables were most important, and how to account for confidence/uncertainty in the predictions.</p>
<p>Hint: take a look at the help file for the <code>predict()</code> function.</p>
